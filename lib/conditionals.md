# What is a conditional?

A conditional is a comparison made between two arguments to determine whether it is true or false. These usually begin as if or else statements. 

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

A '=' is an assignment. Meaning that anything on the right of the '=' will be assigned to whatever is on the left. This is often used to assign variables. The '==' is a comparison. So in the example of a conditional, whatever is on the left will be compared to whatever is on the right and a True or False answer will be determined.
